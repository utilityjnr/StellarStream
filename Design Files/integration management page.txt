Stellar Stream Management and Creation UI
1. Real-Time Integration & Monitoring
Copy: LIVE CONNECTION | Total Value Streamed | Integration Actions

I worked on the real-time status dashboard to ensure users have instant visibility into their network health, featuring metrics like API Latency and Uptime.

I ensured that the "Integration Actions" included immediate controls to pause or stop the connection, giving admins a "kill switch" for their enterprise environment during network maintenance.

2. Dynamic Stream Creation Flow
Copy: Set the pace | Configure real-time asset delivery | Start Streaming Asset

I worked on the multi-step "Set the pace" desktop flow to ensure that complex configurations—like Billing Interval and Duration—are broken down into digestible steps.

I ensured the inclusion of a "Stream Summary" sidebar. I worked on this to provide a live TOTAL COMMITMENT calculation, so users see the full financial impact before they click Continue.

I worked on the "Recipient Mapping" feature, allowing for bulk CSV uploads or manual entry to streamline the onboarding of large teams.

3. Active Stream Controls & Analytics
Copy: Engineering Payroll | Marketing Retention | EST. 4H LEFT

I worked on the detailed card view for active streams, ensuring that Progress percentages and Ends in X days markers are updated in real-time.

I ensured that granular controls like Pause, Resume, and Cancel are accessible directly on each stream card to minimize navigation time.

I worked on adding the Last Sync timer to the mobile view, ensuring that users can trust the data they are seeing is up-to-the-minute accurate.

4. Connection & Security Management
Copy: Connection Status: Connected | Disconnect Integration

I worked on the "Integration Detail" view to provide technical transparency, listing the Provider and Node Location for compliance and auditing purposes.

I ensured that the Disconnect Integration action is highlighted in red and separated from standard controls to prevent accidental de-linking of enterprise wallets.
