Stellar Stream Search and Result UI. 

Navigation & Global Search Copy: Search streams, wallets, 
or hashes...

I worked on the integration of the $⌘K$ command palette shortcut to prioritize efficiency for power users.I ensured that the "Recent Searches" section remains manageable by adding a "Clear All" action, specifically to help users quickly wipe sensitive payroll queries like Engineering Payroll Q4.

2. Advanced Filtering Logic Copy: Filter Results | Reset All | Show 24 ResultsI worked on the transition from inline filters to a dedicated bottom-sheet modal to reduce visual noise on mobile devices.I ensured that the Asset Type selection uses clear, icon-backed segmented pickers for XLM and USDC. 

This makes asset switching intuitive and reduces errors during high-volume financial auditing.I worked on adding descriptive subtext for technical filters, such as "Filter by speed of transfer" for Stream Rate Range, to help users distinguish between the velocity of a stream and its total volume.

3. Stream Result Cards Copy: STREAM RATE | TOTAL STREAMED | STREAMS FOUND (12)
I worked on the information hierarchy of the result cards, placing the live 0.05 USDC / sec rate in a bold blue to emphasize real-time movement.I ensured the progress bars provide immediate visual feedback. By calculating the percentage (e.g., 56.8% Completed), 

I give the user a concrete sense of time remaining without them having to do the math.I worked on the status badge system, using a high-visibility amber for PAUSED states to alert users to streams that require attention or manual intervention.4. Interactive Components Copy: DASHBOARD, SEARCH, STREAM, WALLET, SETTINGS

I worked on the navigation bar layout to ensure the Search function feels like a core utility rather than a secondary feature.I ensured the floating action button (FAB) for STREAM is the most prominent element, guiding the user toward the app's primary value proposition: creating new payment streams.
