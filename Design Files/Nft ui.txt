This is a UI/UX issue only.

Based on the images you provided, here is the UI copy for the Stellar Stream project.

Dashboard | Performance Metrics
NFT Pools Yield: I worked on the Stellar Stream yield card to show the aggregated yield across all active liquidity pools.

Royalties Stream: I worked on the Stellar Stream status indicator to confirm that real-time distributions are actively routing to the vault.

Floor-Price Drift: I worked on the Stellar Stream volatility index to track 24h market fluctuations relative to pool depth.

Asset Selection | "Asset Basket" Flow
Rarity-Risk Warning: I worked on the Stellar Stream rarity alert to notify users when depositing high-value assets into the pool.

LP Token Estimation: I worked on the Stellar Stream minting calculator to show an estimate of vNFT tokens based on current floor prices.

Empty Basket State: I worked on the Stellar Stream empty state copy to guide users to select assets and initiate their first stream.

Deposit Action: I worked on the Stellar Stream deposit trigger to finalize the asset commitment.

My Liquidity Positions | Management
Position Health (68%): I worked on the Stellar Stream risk management copy to warn users when their position is nearing a liquidation threshold.

Position Health (92%): I worked on the Stellar Stream health indicator to signal when a position is well-collateralized and earning maximum rewards.

Live Earnings: I worked on the Stellar Stream reward tracker to display yield accrued since the last successful claim.

System Notifications
Success Message: I worked on the Stellar Stream confirmation prompt for when assets are successfully added to the liquidity network.

Connection Status: I worked on the Stellar Stream synchronization label to verify the wallet is securely linked.
