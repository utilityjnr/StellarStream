Stellar Stream Account & Settings UI
1. Organization & Identity Management
Copy: Organization Details | Stellar Stream Labs | ORG - SS - 889 - 442 - 990

I worked on the layout for the organization profile to ensure that mission-critical data, like the unique Organization ID, is easily copyable with a single click for administrative reporting.

I ensured that the Network Status is prominently displayed as Stellar Mainnet with a "Synchronized" badge. This gives the user immediate confidence that their enterprise environment is live and communicating correctly with the ledger.

2. Payroll & Precision Preferences
Copy: Payroll Preferences | Default Stream Rate (Per Month) | Stream Precision

I worked on the stream rate calculation logic, adding the subtext Calculated approx: 0.081 USDC / minute. I ensured this was included so admins can understand the granular velocity of their payroll before committing to a monthly total.

I worked on the Stream Precision dropdown (e.g., 6 Decimals) to provide the level of mathematical accuracy required for high-volume Web3 disbursements.

I ensured the Auto-stream New Employees toggle included clear descriptive text: "Automatically initialize payroll streams for newly added wallets." This automates the onboarding process while keeping the admin in control.

3. Treasury & Wallet Security
Copy: Primary Wallet | Main Treasury | MULTI-SIG

I worked on the wallet card design to clearly differentiate between a standard wallet and a MULTI-SIG setup.

I ensured that the SECURITY PROTOCOL warning was highlighted in amber. I worked on this copy to explicitly state that changes to default assets require multi-sig approval from 2/3 guardians, preventing any single point of failure in the enterprise treasury.

4. Global Actions & Navigation
Copy: Apply Preferences | Discard Changes | Save Changes

I worked on the persistent "Save Changes" button in the header and the bottom action bar. I ensured that "Apply Preferences" is the primary high-contrast action to guide the user toward finalizing their configuration.

I ensured the sidebar navigation clearly separates Wallets, Payroll, and Settings, reflecting the mental model of an enterprise treasurer.
